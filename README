This is a prototype of a clustered system built with Lucy


The system should work by distributing a Lucy index on many nodes. 
The main difference in the interface a user will see is.

Cluster configuration is handled from the bottom up. What I mean by this is the Lucy indexes on disk
can appear from any number of techniques. Starting up a cluster_searcher and pointing him to a 
cluster aggregator should be all that is needed to expose a index to a user. Aggregator processes
may be stacked. An aggregator ONLY talks to people  below him and people above him. 



\bin\
  cluster_write_node.pl
     tbd 
  cluster_search_node.pl  (~1 per-core)
    This guy is our async multi-searcher using cluster_searchers.
  
  cluster_searcher.pl (N per cluster_node)
    This guy does blocking searches on the indexes at the cluster_search_node's request.
    (the index being multi-searched)
